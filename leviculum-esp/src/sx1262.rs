//! The SX1262's SPI port on an ESP32-class board.
//!
//! This is a *bus*, not a driver. Everything that decides what goes on the
//! air — the opcode sequences, the register brackets, the transmit-power
//! program, the IRQ masks, the RX-extend arithmetic — lives in
//! [`leviculum_core::sx126x`], where a host test can run it against a fake
//! chip. That module reaches the hardware through exactly two traits,
//! [`RegisterBus`] and
//! [`CommandBus`], and what this file
//! adds is their implementation over an esp-hal SPI bus and two GPIOs.
//!
//! The same division is already in place on the nRF side
//! (`leviculum-nrf/src/sx1262.rs`, two forwarding methods at the bottom of
//! a 1300-line driver). Writing a second SX1262 driver here would mean a
//! second copy of the sequences, which is a second thing to keep in step
//! with the datasheet and with the reference firmware; the whole reason
//! the sequences were lifted into `leviculum-core` was that a constant or
//! an ordering that lives in one firmware crate is one nothing can check.
//!
//! # What this file owns
//!
//! Three things, and they are the three the chip's SPI protocol demands
//! (SX1262 datasheet rev 2.1, §13.1 and §13.2):
//!
//!  * the frame around a command — chip-select low, opcode, arguments,
//!    chip-select high;
//!  * the frame around a register access, which is a command
//!    (`WriteRegister` 0x0D / `ReadRegister` 0x1D) with a 16-bit address
//!    and, on the read side, one status byte to discard before the data;
//!  * the BUSY handshake, which precedes every one of them: the chip
//!    raises BUSY while it digests the previous command and ignores the
//!    bus until it drops.
//!
//! # Blocking inside an `async fn`
//!
//! The two traits are async because the nRF driver behind them is. Here
//! the BUSY poll spins rather than yields. That is honest for what this
//! step is — nothing else runs yet, there is no executor — but it is not
//! where it should end up, and the bound is written as a deadline rather
//! than a retry count so that turning the spin into a yield is a change to
//! one statement and not to the shape of the function.
