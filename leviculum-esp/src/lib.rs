//! Reticulum firmware for ESP32-class boards.
//!
//! The sibling of `leviculum-nrf`, on the other half of the hardware we
//! own: the Heltec V3/V4 and T-Beam boards, and the XIAO ESP32-S3 +
//! Wio-SX1262 kit, that today run somebody else's firmware because we had
//! none of our own for the family. The first target is the Heltec WiFi
//! LoRa 32 V4 (ESP32-S3R2 + SX1262 + KCT8103L front end); the second is
//! the XIAO kit (ESP32-S3R8 + the same bare SX1262 the nRF kit mounts,
//! on different pads).
//!
//! # What this crate is, at this step
//!
//! It boots, it says what it is, and it holds the SX1262's SPI port open.
//! Nothing goes on the air. The point of the step is not the banner — it
//! is that the shape a second and third board plug into exists before the
//! first board's details have hardened around it:
//!
//!  * the per-board facts live in [`boards`], one module per wiring, each
//!    constant carrying the document it was read out of;
//!  * the per-class facts live here: the init order, the clock, the USB
//!    serial the banner leaves by, the banner itself;
//!  * the radio is reached through [`leviculum_core::sx126x`]'s two
//!    traits, implemented once in [`sx1262`], so the sequences that decide
//!    what goes on the air stay in the crate that has host tests.
//!
//! # The build stamp
//!
//! [`FW_BUILD_STAMP`] is the same one contiguous literal `leviculum-nrf`
//! carries, produced by the same `build.rs`, printed after the same
//! `[FW_BUILD] ` prefix. The rig's flasher and the reviewer's boot proof
//! grep one shape; a firmware family that printed a second shape would be
//! a firmware family the proof cannot read.
