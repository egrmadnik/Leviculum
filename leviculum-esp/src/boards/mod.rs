//! Board-specific pin mappings and shared board metadata for the ESP32
//! class.
//!
//! # What "class" means here, and why the split is drawn now
//!
//! This crate exists to serve the ESP32-class boards (Heltec V3, Heltec
//! V4, the T-Beams, the XIAO ESP32-S3 + Wio-SX1262 kit) that differ in
//! SoC family (ESP32 vs ESP32-S3), in radio part and in front end, but
//! agree on everything the firmware does above the
//! pin: one `esp_hal::init`, one clock configuration, one USB serial the
//! banner goes out of, one SX1262 command sequence set out of
//! [`leviculum_core::sx126x`]. The split therefore runs exactly along
//! "does this fact change when the board changes":
//!
//!  * **per board** — which GPIO carries which net, which of them the
//!    radio uses, where the LED sits and in which direction it conducts,
//!    the battery divider ratio, whether a GNSS receiver is fitted. All
//!    of it in `boards/<board>.rs`, every constant carrying the document
//!    it was read out of.
//!  * **per class** — the order init runs in, the clock, bringing up the
//!    USB Serial/JTAG peripheral, formatting and emitting the boot
//!    banner. All of it in `lib.rs`, taking a `&'static BoardConfig` so
//!    one code path serves every binary target.
//!
//! Adding the second board is then: one `boards/<name>.rs` with its pins
//! and its `CONFIG`, one `src/bin/<name>.rs` that hands those pins to the
//! shared init, one `[[bin]]` stanza and one `Justfile` recipe. No new
//! idiom, and nothing in `lib.rs` moves.
//!
//! One build per pinout family remains the policy
//! (`docs/src/concepts/board-support-scope.md`): a board file describes a
//! wiring, not a stock-keeping unit, and two boards that agree on every
//! net share one binary.
