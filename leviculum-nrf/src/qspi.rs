//! The QSPI NOR flash three of our four boards turned out not to carry.
//!
//! **The T114, the RAK4631 and the XIAO kit carry none, and one board
//! does ask:** the
//! SolarNode's `CONFIG.qspi_part` is [`P25Q16H`] and `bin/solarnode.rs`
//! calls [`identify_at_boot`] once at boot. The two negatives came from
//! an `EXTERNAL_FLASH_DEVICES` line in a vendor variant header, and on
//! both vendors that line is a template default sitting under a comment
//! that denies the part: Heltec commented the T114's QSPI pins out, RAK
//! wrote "No onboard flash" over the RAK4631's and marked the pins
//! "occupied by GPIO's". Three units — two T114s and the field Pocket —
//! answer nothing to `05h`, `9Fh`, `90h` or the datasheet reset while
//! every pin follows our drive. The XIAO kit's "none" is plainer still:
//! its own variant comments the `PIN_QSPI_*` block and the
//! `EXTERNAL_FLASH_DEVICES` line out, and the plain XIAO it ships marks
//! U7 `DNP` on the module's schematic. All three `CONFIG.qspi_part` are
//! `None`, all three
//! firmwares print `[QSPI] NONE board=<b>` at boot instead of coming
//! here, and the evidence with its URLs is in
//! `leviculum-nrf/src/boards/t114.rs`,
//! `leviculum-nrf/src/boards/rak4631.rs` and
//! `leviculum-nrf/src/boards/xiaokit.rs` (Codeberg #384).
//!
//! The SolarNode is a different claim and it is not a variant header's:
//! Seeed's own schematic for the XIAO nRF52840 Plus module draws U7, an
//! 8-pin NOR flash, on six named `P0.2x_QSPI_*` nets. What that
//! schematic does NOT print is the part number or whether the footprint
//! is populated, and the sheet for the plain (non-Plus) XIAO v1.1 draws
//! the same U7 with the value **`DNP`** — do not populate. So the board
//! file states the wiring from the schematic and the part number from
//! the two Seeed variant headers, and the boot line is what settles
//! whether anything answers. That is the whole point of asking:
//! `boards/solarnode.rs` says what is expected, the board says what is
//! there.
//!
//! Do not re-point the other two at this module on the strength of a
//! variant header: `scripts/check-nrf-board-pins.sh` refuses that, and
//! the day it is right, the check is the place to say so.
//!
//! What it drives, when something does: 2 MB of [`P25Q16H`] on the
//! SolarNode, and 1 MB of [`IS25LP080D`] was what the Pocket was
//! believed to carry. Codeberg #384 and
//! `docs/src/concepts/propagation-node-on-a-board.md` ask what to put in
//! such a part; this module is only the part that gets there — the
//! peripheral, the part's identity, and the `embedded_storage` NorFlash
//! surface the record log ([`leviculum_record_log`]) wants underneath it.
//!
//! # The storage trait shape
//!
//! There is nothing to wrap. `embassy_nrf::qspi::Qspi` already implements
//! `ReadNorFlash`/`NorFlash` (and their async twins) with `ERASE_SIZE`
//! 4096, `WRITE_SIZE` 4 and `READ_SIZE` 4, which is exactly the shape
//! `flash.rs` already uses for the internal NVMC and the SoftDevice flash.
//! So this module builds a `Qspi`, proves it is talking to the part we
//! think it is, and hands it back. Anything that adds a layer here adds
//! flash and a place for a bug.
//!
//! What it does *not* do is give the caller a device before it knows what
//! is on the other end. [`identify_at_boot`] returns `None` on a JEDEC id
//! that is not the board's part, and dropping the `Qspi` deactivates the
//! peripheral: **a board with an unexpected part says so and writes
//! nothing.** That is deliberate — the store's whole safety argument is
//! about 4 KB sectors, a 0xFF erased state and program-once bits, and none
//! of those are true of a part we have not identified.
//!
//! # Why a part carries its own bus speed
//!
//! `Speed::M32` on the ISSI part, because it allows 133 MHz and the
//! nRF52840's own 32 MHz ceiling is what binds there: 16 MB/s, which the
//! concept paper turns into a 0.07 s full-store scan — the number that
//! makes an on-flash directory affordable and a RAM index unnecessary.
//!
//! The PUYA part is where that reasoning stopped being enough. Its `fC`
//! is 104 MHz for `FAST_READ` (`0Bh`, one dummy byte, the opcode this
//! driver uses on it) and every other command the probe issues (P25Q16H
//! datasheet, Table 5-3 "AC parameters"), so the part allows 32 MHz. The
//! SolarNode's bus does not read at it with margin: on 2026-10-04
//! everything the self-test programmed read back clean at 8 MHz and wrong
//! at 32 MHz in about 80 % of the bytes, 99.8 % of those differing from
//! one read to the next, and the read sweep of 2026-10-05 found 32 MHz
//! clean at one sampling delay only and 16 MHz clean at three (Codeberg
//! #435, [`P25Q16H_BUS`]). The clock a board reads cleanly at is a property of
//! the part, the board and the sampling delay together, which is why a
//! part carries a whole [`BusTiming`] and why the P25Q16H's is measured.
//!
//! `Speed::M8` also exists for the other kind of part, the low-power one
//! whose quad read tops out at 8 MHz in its default ultra-low-power mode
//! (the MX25R1635F is the example, and the reason the conservative
//! timings below are taken from its datasheet).
//!
//! # Quad enable
//!
//! Every part powers up in single-line SPI mode with the QE bit of its
//! status register clear, and the `READ4IO`/`PP4IO` opcodes this driver
//! configures by default do not work until it is set. **Where that bit
//! lives is a property of the part, not of the bus**, which is why
//! [`FlashPart`] carries a [`QuadEnable`] rather than this module
//! knowing one recipe. Macronix and ISSI put it in bit 6 of the one
//! status register ([`QuadEnable::StatusBit6`]); PUYA puts it in S9, bit
//! 1 of status register 2, read with `35h` and written as the second
//! byte of a two-byte `01h` (P25Q16H datasheet, "Status Register" and
//! §10.5). Bit 6 of a PUYA status register is a block-protection bit, so
//! the Macronix recipe applied to that part would not fail — it would
//! write-protect it.
//!
//! [`QuadEnable::Untouched`] is therefore not a gap: it is the honest
//! state for a part nothing reads yet. The probe then writes no
//! non-volatile register at all and configures the single-line
//! `FASTREAD`/`PP` opcodes, which work at the QE=0 every part leaves the
//! factory in. It is what the SolarNode's [`P25Q16H`] uses.
//!
//! When QE is set, the write-enable the part needs first is supplied by
//! the QSPI peripheral itself: every custom instruction it issues has
//! `CINSTRCONF.WREN` set (`custom_instruction_start`,
//! `embassy-nrf-0.9.0/src/qspi.rs`), and `WIPWAIT` makes it wait for the
//! part to finish. One byte of data, so the Macronix configuration
//! registers — which hold the ultra-low-power bit — keep their values.
//!
//! # Deep power down
//!
//! Both parts have a Deep Power Down state in which they answer nothing,
//! drive nothing, and — this is the part that bites — survive a warm
//! reset. Firmware that put the part to sleep once leaves it asleep for
//! every boot after, and the symptom is a JEDEC read that succeeds and
//! returns `00:00:00`: the peripheral clocked the opcode out, and nothing
//! on the bus ever pulled MISO high. A wrong pin map looks the same from
//! the log line, which is why the pins are gated separately
//! (`scripts/check-nrf-board-pins.sh`) and why this boots with a release.
//!
//! So [`identify_at_boot`] sends Release from Deep Power Down (0xAB)
//! before it asks anything, waits out the parts' recovery time, and reads
//! JEDEC. A release sent to an awake part is a no-op, so it is
//! unconditional rather than a flag. A first read that still comes back
//! silent earns exactly one retry, because on the Macronix part it is the
//! CS# pulse and not the opcode that does the releasing (rev. 1.6,
//! §10-24) — so the first read may be the thing that woke it. Both
//! answers go on the log line, `id=` and `id2=`, and one boot then says
//! whether the part is asleep, awake, or not there at all.
//!
//! # The second opinion on `no-answer`
//!
//! `id=00:00:00 id2=00:00:00 state=no-answer` is where that sentence runs
//! out. It says nobody drove MISO — it does not say why, and the two
//! reasons lead to completely different work:
//!
//! | The hand-clocked read says | conclusion |
//! |---|---|
//! | the expected id | the part is there and the QSPI setup does not reach it. That is our bug, and it would be on the other board too. |
//! | all zeros | nothing drives MISO under either driver. The part is absent or unpowered on this unit, and no code fixes that. |
//! | something else | a third thing, and the bytes are the evidence for whatever it is. |
//!
//! So before it gives up, that path drops the peripheral, takes the same
//! pins back as ordinary GPIOs, and asks again by hand at 250 kHz
//! (`bitbang_second_opinion` below, shifter in
//! [`leviculum_qspi_bitbang`]). Four extra `[QSPI]` lines, then `None`
//! exactly as before. Everything it sends is a read or the datasheet reset
//! pair; nothing it sends writes to the part, and the shifter has no
//! opcode that could — not even `06h` WREN.
//!
//! **Only on that path.** A board whose part answers reaches `state=ok`
//! without a single GPIO write from any of this, and its boot is not a
//! cycle slower.
//!
//! # What the four lines say
//!
//! The first batch asked `9Fh` once and stopped, and `00:00:00` from that
//! one question turned out to be a reading the part's own datasheet
//! forbids taking at face value. Two sentences of Macronix MX25R1635F
//! rev. 1.6 are why this path grew:
//!
//! - **§10-3**, "While Program/Erase operation is in progress, it will not
//!   decode the RDID instruction." A busy part is mute to `9Fh`
//!   *specifically*. `05h` answers in that state, and it is the question
//!   we had never asked first.
//! - **Pin 7 is HOLD# *or* RESET#** depending on the part's configuration.
//!   If it is acting as RESET# and sits low, nothing answers whatever is
//!   sent — and before our init that pin is an input with no pull, i.e.
//!   floating.
//!
//! So the path now proves our own side first, then asks the part the
//! questions it is allowed to answer. All four readings are pre-registered
//! below, so a capture is read against a table written before the boot
//! rather than interpreted after it.
//!
//! ## `[QSPI] PINS sck=<ok|stuck> cs=.. io0=.. io1=.. io2=.. io3=..`
//!
//! Each pin driven to both levels and read back through its own input
//! buffer. `stuck` means the readback did not follow. This proves the MCU
//! controls the lines before anything is concluded about what is on them;
//! a `stuck` here makes every line after it uninterpretable.
//!
//! ## `[QSPI] MISO pullup=<0|1> pulldown=<0|1>`
//!
//! CS# high, so a part that is present has released IO1 (its SO). The line
//! is then read once under the nRF's internal pull-up and once under its
//! pull-down. **This line alone cannot say a part is absent**, and the
//! first batch registered it as if it could:
//!
//! | pullup / pulldown | conclusion |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1 / 0 | the line follows our pull, which is what a deselected part is *supposed* to do: SO is high-impedance while CS# is high. A healthy board reads this, and so does an empty footprint. No conclusion. |
//! | 0 / 0 | something holds it low while nothing should: a short, the header, or a part not releasing SO. |
//! | 1 / 1 | something holds it high while nothing should. |
//!
//! So the two rows that mean something are the ones that contradict a
//! released bus. `1 / 0` is the reading to ignore, and the evidence for
//! an absent part has to come from the opcodes below, not from here.
//!
//! ## `[QSPI] BITBANG id=<hh:hh:hh> clk_khz=..`
//!
//! `9Fh` by hand, before the reset. Unchanged from the first batch, and
//! the "before" half of the pair the line below completes.
//!
//! ## `[QSPI] PROBE rdsr=<hh> rdid=<hh:hh:hh> rems=<hh:hh> after_reset=1 wip=<0|1>`
//!
//! The datasheet's own wake-up sequence — `66h`/`99h` with WP# and HOLD#
//! held high — and then the three read opcodes:
//!
//! | observed | conclusion |
//! |---|---|
//! | any of them non-zero and non-`ff` | the part is alive; the earlier silence was a state the reset cleared |
//! | `rdsr` answers, `rdid` does not | the part is busy (WIP set, `wip=1`), §10-3 |
//! | all `00` | nothing on the bus responds under any command |
//! | all `ff` | the bus floats high; with `pulldown=0` above that is a contradiction worth its own line |
//!
//! One pass, one line each. No retries and no frequency ladder: this runs
//! on a board that has already failed to answer, the caller returns `None`
//! whatever comes back, and a ladder would produce more lines and no more
//! information than the first.

/// where the part would program or erase.
///
/// Stage 1a's IO3 test is also the first thing on this board that ever
/// gives pin 7 a defined low and then a defined high. On a part where that
/// pin is configured as RESET# rather than HOLD#, that *is* a hardware
/// reset, and the `PROBE` line below is read after it — which is one more
/// reason `after_reset=1` is on that line and not on `BITBANG`.

/// question plus `05h` and `90h` after it, which is what `after_reset=1`
/// on that line means. The pair is the evidence for whether the reset
/// changed anything, and neither line alone is.
///
/// # Two details of the wiring
///
/// - IO1 is read with a **pull-down** during the transfers. Without one,
///   an undriven wire is a floating input and the bytes would be noise
///   rather than evidence, so `00:00:00` has to be made to mean something:
///   it means the wire never left the level the nRF's own internal pull
///   put it at. A part that is present drives IO1 push-pull and wins
///   against a pull of that order easily, so it cannot suppress a real
///   answer — which also makes `ff:ff:ff` a genuine "something else" here
///   and not the idle reading it would be under a pull-up. (Stage 1b reads
///   it under both pulls on purpose; that is the one place the pull is the
///   measurement rather than a floor under it.)
/// - IO2 and IO3 are driven high from the end of stage 1b onwards. They
///   are the part's WP# and pin 7, and pin 7 is HOLD# *or* RESET#: a part
///   with HOLD# low suspends the transfer and answers nothing, and a part
///   held in RESET# answers nothing at all. The QSPI peripheral was doing
///   this implicitly through `CINSTRCONF.LIO2`/`LIO3`
///   (`embassy-nrf-0.9.0/src/qspi.rs:290`); by hand it is explicit, and
///   [`HOLD_SETTLE_CYCLES`] is the recovery time that follows raising them.
///
/// One ambiguity this does not resolve, and should not be read past: a
/// part still in Deep Power Down answers nothing to `9Fh` here either,
/// because the only opcode it would honour is `0xAB`. `identify_at_boot`
/// already sent `0xAB` and pulsed CS# low three times before reaching this
/// branch, so on any board where the QSPI reaches the part the part is
/// awake — and on a board where it does not, the interesting rows of the
/// tables are the ones where something *answers*, which no amount of sleep
/// can fake.
///
/// # What it leaves behind
///
/// Exactly the pin states `Qspi::drop` left: SCK, IO0..IO3 disconnected
/// (`Flex::drop` writes the same `PIN_CNF` that `gpio::deconfigure_pin`
/// does), and CS# still an output driven high. That last one is not an
/// oversight in either place — embassy leaves CSN driven on purpose, so a
/// part in Deep Power Down does not read a floating CS# as a select and
/// wake up on its own — so this path restores it rather than "cleaning it
/// up" into a state its caller never had. A later `Qspi::new` on these
/// pins therefore starts from the same place it would have without this
