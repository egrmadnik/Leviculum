//! Board-specific pin mappings and shared board metadata.
//!
//! # The antenna switch is a two-shaped thing
//!
//! Every board here sets `SetDIO2AsRfSwitch` — the SX1262 raises DIO2
//! for the duration of a transmit and the board's switch follows it.
//! On the T114 and the RAK4631 that is the whole story, and both board
//! files say so out loud: the RAK's antenna-switch pad exists on the
//! schematic and must NOT be driven, because DIO2 owns it.
//!
//! The Wio-SX1262 splits the job, wherever it is mounted — on the solar
//! node's carrier and on the plain XIAO kit alike. DIO2 still steers
//! the transmit side, but the receive side is a host GPIO
//! ([`solarnode::LoRaRxEnable`], [`xiaokit::LoRaRxEnable`]) that has to
//! be asserted for a listening window and released before a key-up —
//! with both asserted at once the switch is in neither position and the
//! transmit goes nowhere.
//!
//! So a board's front end is not one boolean any more. It is: DIO2,
//! always; plus an OPTIONAL host-driven RX-enable pin, which a board
//! module declares as a type alias exactly like every other pin it
//! owns, and which its binary hands to [`crate::lora::init`] as
//! `Some(..)`. The pin cannot live in [`BoardConfig`] — a `Peri` is a
//! moved handle, not a `const` — and it is deliberately not mirrored
//! there as a flag either: the driver takes the pin itself, so a second
//! copy of the fact could only ever be a copy that disagrees. The
//! switching lives in `sx1262.rs` and `lora.rs`, i.e. in the interface,
//! because knowing that this medium has a front end to steer is exactly
//! the interface's business (`docs/src/concepts/interface-isolation.md`).
//! Nothing about it reaches `transport.rs`.
