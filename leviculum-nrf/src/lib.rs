//! Reticulum firmware support for nRF52840-based boards
//!
//! Provides heap allocator setup, board-specific pin mappings,
//! USB CDC-ACM debug logging, and Reticulum transport interface.
//!
//! # Nothing here is tested
//!
//! This crate cannot run a host test — both BSP features route through
//! `softdevice`, one of them is mandatory (the `compile_error!` pair
//! below), and `nrf-softdevice-s140` does not compile for a host triple.
//! Every `#[test]` in this workspace lives in one of the pure member
//! crates beside it, and every assertion written here instead would need
//! a board and an hour of the one rig.
//!
//! So a decision — a cadence, a threshold, an ordering, a predicate, an
//! arithmetic budget, a byte-exact line other tools grep — belongs in a
//! member crate, and this crate calls it. What stays is what takes a pin,
//! a register, a SoftDevice syscall or an `embassy_time::Instant`. The
//! policy, the seam's current extent and the decisions still stranded in
//! `src/` are in `docs/src/concepts/firmware-host-test-seam.md`.
