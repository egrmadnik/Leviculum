//! Firmware entry point for the Seeed XIAO nRF52840 + Wio-SX1262 kit
//!
//! Runs a Reticulum transport node with three interfaces:
//! - Interface 0: USB CDC-ACM serial (HDLC framing) to host
//! - Interface 1: SX1262 LoRa radio, on the Wio-SX1262 module
//! - Interface 2: BLE peripheral (Columba v2.2 protocol)
//!
//! The transport engine routes packets between all interfaces.
//!
//! Two Seeed modules on the XIAO's headers and no carrier board: this
//! file is the solar node's binary minus the carrier — the radio map is
//! identical (the Wio-SX1262 sits on the same pads in both products), and
//! what actually changes is everything the carrier used to provide. The
//! LED is the XIAO module's own common-anode RGB, **active low** where
//! the carrier's were active high; there is no QSPI part on the plain
//! XIAO and no user button; and the L76K GNSS, an add-on here, has no
//! enable line of its own — a kit without one reports `no-hardware` at
//! run time (`boards/xiaokit.rs`, `docs/src/firmware/boards.md` Family C).
