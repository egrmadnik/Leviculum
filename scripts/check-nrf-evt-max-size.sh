# BLE event-buffer gate for the nRF firmware.
#
# nrf-softdevice sizes the buffer it passes to `sd_ble_evt_get` at compile
# time from a feature (`evt-max-size-256` / `-512`), defaulting to 128 bytes
# when none is selected, and panics unconditionally when an event does not fit
# (nrf-softdevice/src/events.rs:92). Our GATT characteristics are 251 bytes
# wide, so a full-size write from a peer that negotiated a large ATT MTU is a
# 269-byte event: on the default 128 every LNode panicked and reset within
# seconds of a real Android client connecting (Codeberg #354).
#
# Nothing else in the suite catches losing that feature again. It is not
# visible to the firmware's own `cfg`s (a dependency's features are not
# `cfg(feature = ..)` in the dependent), the LNode-to-LNode bench negotiates a
# small MTU and stays under 128, and a firmware missing the feature builds and
# links cleanly. So the assertion is made against cargo's resolved feature
# graph — the same resolution the build uses, not the manifest text.
#
# Usage: check-nrf-evt-max-size.sh [feature]
