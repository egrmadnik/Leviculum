#
# Record-store gap gate for the nRF firmware (Codeberg #384).
#
# The store's 64 KiB region sits above the firmware image, with the boot-record
# page (#380) between them (`leviculum-nrf/memory.x`: FLASH ends at 0xD9000,
# BOOT is 0xD9000-0xDA000, STORE runs 0xDA000-0xEA000). An image that grows into
# either would erase the board's message store, or its restart count, on the
# next UF2 flash.
#
# The GAP this gate prints is therefore measured to the BOOT page, not to the
# store: the boot page is what the image runs into first, and a gap measured
# past it would overstate the headroom by exactly one page.
#
# WHAT THE LINKER ALREADY REFUSES, without this gate:
#   * an image whose sections do not fit FLASH - "section `.text' will not fit
#     in region `FLASH'" - because FLASH now stops where BOOT starts;
#   * FLASH enlarged over BOOT, BOOT over STORE, STORE pushed into the
#     persistence pages at USER_FLASH_END, or either region sized off the 4 KiB
#     page grid: the ASSERTs at the bottom of memory.x.
# All three are link errors, so they cannot reach a board.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE ADDS:
#   1. The NUMBER, printed for every bin on every run. A link error is a cliff
#      with no warning track: it says "does not fit" the first time it does not
#      fit, and nothing before that says the gap is down to 8 KiB. The trend is
#      the useful part, and only a printed number has one. Pass a minimum gap to
#      turn the trend into a gate: `check-nrf-store-gap.sh 65536`.
#   2. It measures the image AS FLASHED - the PT_LOAD segments' physical
#      addresses and file sizes, which is what `objcopy -O binary` and the .uf2
#      are built from - rather than the sections the linker charged to FLASH. A
#      section placed at an absolute address by a future `SECTIONS` edit lands
#      in the .bin and in no region's accounting.
#   3. It reads the bounds from `__srecord_store`/`__erecord_store` and
#      `__sboot_record` in the linked ELF: the values the FIRMWARE mounts and
#      writes, not the ones memory.x appears to say. An edit that moves a region
#      but not its symbol (or the other way round) is invisible to every ASSERT
#      written in terms of ORIGIN(STORE) or ORIGIN(BOOT).
#
# Positive control for the comparison itself: a minimum gap nothing could
# satisfy must fail.
#
#   bash scripts/check-nrf-store-gap.sh 999999999   # must report FAIL
#
# Usage: check-nrf-store-gap.sh [min_gap_bytes]
