# Board pin-map gate for the nRF firmware: our pins against the reference.
#
# The two greps that guarded the pin maps before this were both
# internal-consistency checks — no pin aliased twice inside a board file, no
# board's alias used from another board. Both were true of `e5d62b95`, and
# its T114 QSPI map was still wrong: IO2 and IO3 named P1.00/P1.01 where the
# part has WP#/HOLD# on P0.07/P0.05. A map that is consistently wrong is
# consistent, so no check that only reads our own tree could have seen it,
# and only this gate reads the reference.
#
# It was NOT the `id=00:00:00` on the T114's boot line. That reading was
# blamed on the wrong IO3 leaving the part held, and the blame was wrong:
# `blocking_custom_instruction` runs single-line, so a JEDEC read uses SCK,
# CS, IO0 and IO1 only — all four correct in the old map. The pins had to be
# fixed for the quad path regardless, and the flash's silence is a separate
# question that `qspi.rs` answers with a deep-power-down release.
#
# Three claims, in the order they can fail:
#
#   1. Each board file's pin aliases equal the recorded reference numbers.
#   2. The bin's `qspi::identify_and_mount_bounded` / `lora::init` call sites
#      (the bounded step hands its six pins to `identify_at_boot`) pass the
#      same pins as those aliases. This is not redundant: the call sites pass
#      `p.P0_07` peripherals directly, not the aliases, so the alias can be
#      right while the hardware sees something else. Fixing only `boards/`
#      would have left the T114 exactly as red as it was.
#   3. The recorded numbers still match the upstream variant header, when a
#      Meshtastic tree is at hand. Without one, 1 and 2 still run and this
#      one says so rather than passing quietly.
#   4. Each board declares the part the table records, and a board that
#      records `qspi_part = "none"` has no pin table, no `Qspi*` alias and
#      no `identify_at_boot` call anywhere in its bin. That is the T114
#      and the RAK4631 since #384: each vendor's own variant header
#      carries an `EXTERNAL_FLASH_DEVICES` template line under a comment
#      that denies the part — Heltec's with the pins commented out, RAK's
#      under "No onboard flash" — and neither board ever answered a JEDEC
#      read. The XIAO kit joined them for the plainest reason of the
#      three: its own variant comments the whole `PIN_QSPI_*` block out
#      and the plain XIAO it ships marks U7 `DNP`. Re-adding the T114's
#      six would drive whatever a user has plugged into its expansion
#      header and say `id=00:00:00` about it.
#   5. Which board carries which part is stated HERE as well as in the
#      table (`TREE_PARTS`), so that walking a board file and the table
#      back together cannot quietly change the answer — neither of them
#      would contradict the other. Today: t114 none, rak4631 none,
#      xiaokit none, solarnode P25Q16H. The solar node is the one positive, and its
#      evidence is a schematic rather than a variant header; the part
#      NUMBER is still only a header's word, which is why the firmware
#      asks the part its name at boot instead of asserting it
#      (`leviculum-nrf/src/boards/solarnode.rs`). Moving a board here
#      means moving the module doc of `leviculum-nrf/src/qspi.rs` with it.
#
# Claim 3 has a wrinkle on the solar node: Seeed's `PIN_QSPI_*` are
# indices into the `g_ADigitalPinMap` of the variant's `.cpp`, not GPIO
# ordinals, so that board's table carries a `pinmap =` and the gate
# resolves each define through it. Without that the check would compare
# `PIN_QSPI_CS (22)` against P0.25 and fail a correct map.
#
# The XIAO kit adds the second wrinkle: its variant carries three
# mutually exclusive `SX126X_*` pinouts in one header — legacy DIY, the
# 30-pin BTB module and the shipped default — as an `#if`/`#else`
# ladder, so every LoRa define appears three times under one name and a
# raw scan reads the first branch, which is the legacy one nobody
# builds. The table's `unselected` names the two selector macros this
# board does not compile, `active_lines` drops those branches and keeps
# their `#else` halves, and what remains resolves to `D`-tokens
# (`SX126X_CS D4`) — indices into the same kind of `g_ADigitalPinMap`,
# so they go through `pinmap` exactly like the solar node's `(22)`.
#
# A board left with no checked rows at all is an error, not a quiet pass:
# that is the shape a board takes when everything is removed from under
# it, and the T114 passed through it when its QSPI rows went.
#
# The reference numbers and the scope — QSPI and LoRa, and why not the rest —
# live in `leviculum-nrf/reference-pins.toml`.
#
