# Guarantee B step 1 (docs/src/concepts/checks-and-citations.md): a gate that

# `{{manifest}} <name> -- <command>` passes the command's output and exit
# status straight through and writes the manifest beside the other CI run
# state, under ~/.local/state/leviculum-ci/test-manifests/. Step 2 (not built)
# reads the union of those manifests and reports every test in none of them.
#
# It is also what keeps a gate from hanging: it waits for its child to EXIT
# rather than for the output pipe to close, kills the child's process group
# afterwards so a leaked daemon cannot hold the gate open, gives up at 1800 s
# with a named failure, and prints what it had to kill. `just standard` sat for
# two hours on 2026-08-07 for want of the first of those. Per-gate budget:

# runs rustdoc and it costs ~21 s over the workspace, so it is excused from
# `guards` -- and a coder pass therefore has no gate that reads a doc comment
# at all. Pass 344 wrote two links to private items into
# leviculum-lxmf-node/src/telemetry.rs, ran fmt, clippy, `cargo test` and
# `just guards` green, and the red arrived a day later on the land gate with
# sixty-three commits queued behind it.

# leviculum-core 1.9 s, leviculum-lxmf-node 2.2 s, leviculum-lxmf 2.8 s,
# leviculum-std 7.6 s -- so a pass that touched one or two crates pays
# seconds. This recipe docs the union over `origin/master...HEAD` plus the
# working tree, which on a lane with sixty-nine unpushed commits is six
# crates: 0.3 s with nothing dirty, 9.9/11.5/11.8 s in three runs after
# `touch leviculum-core/src/lib.rs`. Over the ten, and it checks host
# workspace crates besides, so it is out of `guards` on both clauses and
# CLAUDE.md's per-batch line names it by hand instead.
#
# Inside `fast` its coverage is a subset of `doc-gate`'s; it sits here to
# fail the tier at the cheap end first, and so that the recipe a coder pass
# is told to run is one the push path exercises rather than a script only
# people run. It costs `fast` +12 s in the touch-core case (12.3 s, and
# `doc-gate` behind it still paid 24.9 s against 26.1 s alone: the two

#   release — overflow-checks off (see [profile.release] in Cargo.toml: it
#             does not set them), so the wrap happens and the SLICE panics.
#             That is the shipped failure mode, and it is also the only arm

#
# `std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64` is compiled only where
# `target_has_atomic = "64"`. A user cross-compiling `lnsd` for a MIPS router
# (mips-unknown-linux-musl, soft float) got three unresolved imports out of
# this crate and had to patch it before it would build; the counters now go
# through `leviculum-std/src/counter64.rs`, which keeps the width and varies
# the mechanism.
#
# The i686 gate above cannot see that class of defect: i686 is 32-bit but it
# HAS a 64-bit atomic (cmpxchg8b), so `rustc --print cfg` lists
# target_has_atomic="64" there and every AtomicU64 resolves. Pointer width and
# atomic width are separate properties and need separate targets.
#
# The target is arm-linux-androideabi, and that choice is about the C compiler
# rather than about Android. The reporter's own triple is tier 3 — rustup
# carries no std for mips-unknown-linux-musl, so a gate cannot `rustup target
# add` it and self-heal the way this one does. Of the targets rustup does
# carry without a 64-bit atomic, all the others (armv5te-unknown-linux-gnueabi
# and -musleabi, powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu) have target_os = "linux", which
# turns on the `[target.'cfg(target_os = "linux")'.dependencies]` block in
# leviculum-std/Cargo.toml: bluer -> dbus -> libdbus-sys, whose build script
# compiles vendored C and wants a cross gcc this gate would then demand of
# every host and of the forge. Android's target_os is "android", the block
# does not apply, and the gate needs nothing rustup cannot install.
#
# Same reason it checks the library and not the binary the reporter built:
# `-p leviculum-cli --bin lnsd` pulls libsqlite3-sys, which compiles C for
# every target there is. A cross-build of the whole daemon is the reporter's
# business and needs their toolchain; what this gate owns is that our Rust
# stops being the reason it fails.
#
# What that costs, said plainly: `interfaces/ble/` is linux-only and therefore
# not compiled here, so an AtomicU64 added inside the BLE interface would pass
# this gate. The rest of the crate is covered.
#
# `cargo check`, not `-D warnings`: dropping the linux-only modules leaves
# `OutgoingPacket.peer` read by nobody, a pre-existing dead_code warning about
# cfg coverage and not about portability. Turning it into an error here would
# make the gate fail for a reason it is not about.
#
# The counters' arithmetic is not checked by this recipe — a cross-check
# compiles and never runs. The mutex arm is compiled on every target so its
# unit tests (`counter64::tests`, including the 2^32 crossing) run in the
# workspace lib suite below.

# the dependency list IS the recipe, so `guards` and `fast` can be diffed

#
# WHY IT EXISTS. These recipes are the ones a coder pass never ran and the
# landing gate did, so they went red an hour after the work was finished, on a
# host nobody was watching: #310 on `check-supervised-spawns`, #316 on
# `check-source-invariant-census`, both on 2026-09-26, an hour of gate each.
# The third came free: `check-source-invariant-census` was already red on
# e69ca01f when this recipe was written, over `identity_persists` added the
# commit before, and `just guards` is what found it.
#
# WHAT IS IN IT. #316 timed `just fast` recipe by recipe on a warm target:
# 761 s in total, of which four recipes carry 68 % (`mvr` 209 s,
# `fuzz-regress` 110 s, `i686-usize-gate` 66 s, `nrf-stack-frames` 50 s) and
# the whole census/guard/selftest block below is about 20 s. Table in the pass
# report, 20260926-215512-316. The 36 recipes here measured 19.7-20.3 s over
# three warm runs and 20.4 s on the first run after a leviculum-core edit --
# no cold-start penalty at all, which is what dropping `nrf-store-gap` below
# bought: with it in, the same two numbers were 20.0 s and 70.3 s.
#
# THE MEMBERSHIP RULE, for whoever adds the next guard: a recipe belongs here
# iff it (a) costs under ten seconds STANDING ALONE after a source edit, (b)
# compiles no part of the workspace for the host, and (c) drives no test target
# of its own. `m0-build-gate` and `lxmf-embedded-gate` are in because their
# compile is one crate for a foreign triple, 0.4 s and 0.5 s measured with
# leviculum-core freshly touched -- (b) is about the workspace build, not about
# cargo. `check-processor-seam` (8.2 s) is under the ten but fails (c), and
# `source-invariant-tests` (18.8 s) fails both (a) and (c) -- but its census
# half is 0.05 s and passes all three, so the census is here and the run is
# not. Without that split the recipe would catch #310's red and not #316's.
#
# "STANDING ALONE" is where the subset #316's report proposed had to be cut by
# one. `nrf-store-gap` reads the linked firmware ELFs and in `fast` it is
# preceded by `nrf-stack-frames`, which builds them; #316 therefore timed it at
# 0.4 s. `guards` excludes `nrf-stack-frames` (50 s), so here the gap gate pays
# for the firmware link itself: 40.3 s with leviculum-core touched, twice the
# whole rest of this recipe, for a guard whose product is a trend NUMBER and
# not one of the two reds above. Out. It stays in `fast`, where it is free.
# Every other member was re-measured the same way (`touch
# leviculum-core/src/lib.rs`, then the recipe alone) and none of them
# free-rides: the worst are `nrf-shellcheck` 5.6 s, `check-supervised-spawns`
# 3.1 s, `nrf-fw-readback` 2.4 s.
#
# NOT a tier. Tiers nest (`standard` contains `fast`); `guards` is a strict
# subset of `fast` and adds nothing to it, so a green `guards` is a cheap
# early verdict on part of Tier 0, never a substitute for it. The land gate
# still runs `fast` and `standard`.
#
# CHECKED, NOT PROMISED. All of the above was true the day it was written and
# nothing kept it true: `check-guards-subset` (in this list, below) reads
# `just --dump` and refuses a `guards` member `fast` never reaches, a member
# the two lists run in different orders, and a member of `fast` that is in
# neither `guards` nor the ledger below. The cost clause is the one thing it
# cannot read, so the ledger is a forced decision instead: whoever puts a
# recipe on the push path either puts it in `guards` or writes the line saying
# why not. Reasons carry the measurement they rest on -- #316's recipe-by-

#   verdict (docs/src/concepts/checks-and-citations.md:600).
#   WHY, and it is the same hole `doc-touched` above was added to close for

#   and left twenty (47992075). Both passes ran fmt, clippy, `cargo test` and
#   `just guards` green, and both reds arrived on the land gate with the lane
#   queued behind them. Scoping the anchor pass to `git diff --name-only` would
#   be cheap enough -- 2.0 s of `git blame` over the 67 citing files that hold
#   a citation into this lane's 153 changed files, against 18.65 s for the

#   the book under `docs/src/`, SECURITY.md, the board catalogue, the
#   build scripts -- `just source-invariant-tests`. A firmware-touching
#   pass runs it always, because the whole deferral and arming instrument
#   lives in one of these targets.
#   WHY, and it is the third turn of the hole `doc-touched` closed for
#   rustdoc and `citation-guard` for citations: nothing else a coder pass
#   runs EXECUTES these targets, and a rename that compiles everywhere
#   turns them red. 10bffcf5 renamed the idle select's outgoing arm in
#   leviculum-nrf/src/lora.rs `data` -> `frame`; the deferral guard finds

# Until #266 nothing between a commit landing on master and a .deb appearing on

#
# NOT an alias for `fast`, because `fast` cannot run in that pipeline's

#   check-submodules      — the pipeline clones with `submodules: false`
#                           (nightly.yml:103-108), so every pin is "missing".
#   lint-nrf              — leviculum-nrf is its own workspace, needs the
#                           thumbv7em target plus flip-link as its linker.
#   nrf-stack-frames      — reads a linked firmware ELF that is never built here.
#   nrf-evt-max-size      — resolves the firmware workspace's feature graph
#                           `--frozen`, so it needs that workspace's git
#                           dependencies already fetched.

#   lxmf-embedded-gate    — thumbv6m / thumbv7em cross-compiles.
#   no-atomic64-gate      — an arm-linux-androideabi cross-check (#415). It
#                           installs its own target, so it would run here, but
#                           it would pay for that download on every container
#                           and the push path already carries it.
# Those keep running on the push path, which has the targets and the submodules.
# What is left is what a submodule-less host-target container can actually
# prove, and it is nearly all of the suite: fmt, clippy, a compile check of
# every workspace target (#220 — `--lib` gates were green on a tree where eight
# integration-test targets did not build), the workspace lib tests, and — since
# Codeberg #312 — the tests that are not in a lib target.
#
# THE TESTS THAT ARE NOT IN A LIB TARGET were the subject of #312, and they are
# not a rounding error: measured on this host with `cargo test --workspace` on
# 2026-09-26, 596 s and green, 5916 tests pass, of which `--lib` selects 4279.
# The other 1637 sat in 134 integration targets, 23 bin unittest targets and 16
# doctest units, and gated nothing here. `scripts/ci-gate-integ.sh` runs them,
# less three suites that read a `reference/` submodule this container does not
# clone; its header names each one, with what covers it instead (the tier-2
# nightly, whose green ref is what the publish gate reads). That script computes
# the target list from the tree rather than carrying a copy of it, because a
# written copy would go stale silently, which is #312's own shape.
#
# check-plain-clone is the one check-* that does belong here, and it goes
# first: it asserts the precondition the rest of this recipe rests on — that
# no crate needs a submodule to compile (#300) — costs one grep, and its
# failure message is worth more than the compiler's when the answer is "the
# fixture moved back into reference/".
#
# It is a recipe rather than four lines of YAML for the reason nightly.yml
# records at :156-159 for the .deb build: a second copy in the pipeline file
# drifts from the gate developers run, and the drift is found the same way.
#
# Measured cold (fresh rust:bookworm, empty target dir and cargo registry,
# 4 cores) on 2026-08-18: 2m12s for the four lines it had then, 3051 tests
# executed across 10 units. The step's provisioning — musl-tools, the rustfmt
# and clippy components, `cargo install just`, one shallow submodule — costs
# 1m11s on top, so the pipeline pays 3m23s to stop shipping untested .debs.
# The submodule fetch left that provisioning with #300; ~5 s and 27 MB less.
# Re-measured after the widening below, on schneckenschreck with an empty
# target dir but a warm cargo registry: 1m58s, 3057 tests across 10 units.
#
# What the #312 line adds to that is measured on the coder host rather than in
# the container: 596 s for all of `cargo test --workspace`, of which the interop
# suite this gate does not run is 182 s, so the test EXECUTION it adds is ~280 s
# on 10 cores. The container also has to link ~150 test binaries that clippy
# only ever compiled to metadata, which is the larger half of the bill and the
# one an interactive measurement here cannot state honestly — the first cold run
# on the runner is the number to write down, and it goes in this comment.
# Budgeting it against the runner's own limit is the point: a gate under ten
# minutes is cheaper than a red master nobody sees until the next nightly.
# THE RUNNER'S NUMBER, read off the Woodpecker API for the step `gate`:
# 965-1185 s cold over the cron pipelines 476-486 and 1174 s on push 488
# (2026-09-26 to 10-04), provisioning included. All of those were red runs,
# but they ran the whole selection to the end (`--no-fail-fast`), so they
# price the work; what they do not include is the release build below, which
# they never did. So the gate went from 3m23s to ~19 min cold, not to "under
# ten", and push 477 ended in exit 124 at 2388 s.
#
# `build-integ-bins` is a line here, not a dependency, so fmt and clippy still
# answer first. Four mvr tests (`lncp_fetch_rust_responder`,
# `unparsable_config_must_not_start_a_daemon`,
# `resource_consecutive_push_window_policy`, `media_silence_restore_signal`)
# spawn the RELEASE binaries periculum mounts, not the debug ones cargo test
# builds, and resolve them under the target dir (`release_bin` in each file).
# Without the build they failed on the forge naming the recipe (pipelines
# 476-488). It is the one list of those binaries (`check-integ-bin-list`), and
# the release profile is a second compile of the dependency graph, which is
# what it costs.
#
# `clippy --all-targets` and no separate `cargo check`: clippy compiles what
# check compiles, so the check line was a second pass over the same targets.
# The lint findings that kept clippy off test code until 2026-08-18 are fixed.

# IP-based, excluded from conformance by its admission rules). Both bind no
# physical device, so this tier needs docker and nothing else. `hardware/` is
# tier 3 and is not run here — periculum would report every one of its
# scenarios SKIPPED_INFRA, which is honest but says nothing.
#
# Exit-code contract: 0 = something ran and nothing was RED, 1 = at least one
# RED, 2 = usage/malformed/internal, 3 = nothing ran at all. The bare
# invocation therefore fails the recipe on 1, 2 and 3, which is what a tier
# gate wants.
# The run that covers everything BY CONSTRUCTION (Guarantee B,
# docs/src/concepts/checks-and-citations.md). Tiers define latency, not
# coverage: `fast` runs `--lib`, `standard` names packages one at a time, and
# 327 ordinary tests were consequently executed by no gate at all (Codeberg
# #194) — whole crates, not stragglers. Naming the missing ones is what
# produced the gap in the first place and loses something again with every new
# test file, so this selects nothing by name. Leaving a test out of the
# complete run is now what has to be declared.
#
# Two commands, because neither spelling covers everything alone. `--all-targets`
# runs every lib, bin and integration target and additionally compiles the six
# leviculum-std examples — but cargo DROPS doctests when it is given, and
# scripts/ignored-counts.txt tracks two doctest units, so `--doc` is its own
# invocation rather than a footnote. The workspace has no bench targets
# (`cargo metadata`, checked 2026-08-06), so `--all-targets` pulls in nothing
# that fails to compile.
#
# `--no-fail-fast` is load-bearing for the manifest, not a convenience: without
# it cargo stops after the first red binary and every later binary goes unrun,
# so a red run would emit a manifest covering a prefix of the workspace while
# looking like the whole of it.
#
# No `--test-threads=1`. It was needed for port contention, which the host-wide
# allocator (leviculum-std/tests/support/port_alloc.rs) removed, and for the
# event-log subscriber suite, which now takes its own lock. Measured green at
# default parallelism, 3669 tests + 28 doctests, 2026-08-06.
#
# Wall time on this host (4 cores, warm target dir): 7m50s + 3s. A fresh
# CARGO_TARGET_DIR adds a full workspace test build on top — which is why this
# one gate raises the wrapper's 1800 s default. 493 s is the longest run the

# marginal cold, and a backstop that fires on an honest cold build is a backstop
# people switch off. The nightly's `timeout 3600` around all of `just complete`
