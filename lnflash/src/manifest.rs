//! Two tables, split by what they describe.
//!
//! * The **catalogue** ([`Catalogue`], `lnflash/catalogue.toml`) holds every
//!   board fact: which USB IDs an LNode answers on, what its bootloader
//!   publishes, where its flash window is, what SoftDevice it needs. These
//!   are properties of the hardware, so the catalogue is compiled into the
//!   binary and is always available.
//! * The **manifest** ([`Manifest`], a bundle's `manifest.toml`) holds what
//!   one firmware release carries: the version, and one image per board with
//!   its checksum.
//!
//! The split is Codeberg #342. The sessions that only configure a board that
//! is already running — `--set-time`, `--set-telemetry` — need the catalogue
//! and no image at all; before the split they loaded the whole bundle
//! manifest to reach the USB IDs and refused to start without one.
//!
//! A catalogue entry is split once more, along the same seam (Codeberg
//! #233). [`Board`] holds what talking to a running board needs — the USB
//! IDs its firmware answers on — and an optional [`Flashing`] holds what
//! writing an image needs: the bootloader's IDs, the `Board-ID` it
//! publishes, the flash window, the SoftDevice constraint. The two rest on
//! different evidence and must not be conflated: a board identifies itself
//! over its transport port before a control frame does anything, while a
//! write rests on a `Board-ID` that on some boards names a module rather
//! than a product. A board whose `Board-ID` is not an identity therefore
//! gets a control-only entry, and [`Confirmed`](crate::flow::Confirmed) —
//! the token every write needs — cannot be made for one at all.
//!
//! The binary is board-agnostic. An `if board == "t114"` anywhere outside
//! this module would mean the split has failed — a new nRF or RP2040 board
//! is meant to be data entry, and a new chip family exactly one new
//! transport (docs/src/concepts/lnode-flashing.md, "Four axes").
//!
//! Two properties are enforced here rather than documented:
//!
//! * **A payload cannot be read without its checksum being verified.**
//!   [`Payload::read`] is the only way to get the bytes and it always hashes
//!   them, so "verify the image checksum" is not a step anyone can forget.
//! * **A third-party blob cannot ship without its licence.** [`Remedy`] has a
//!   mandatory `license` field and loading fails if that file is missing.
//!   Nordic's clause 2 requires the notice to travel with the distribution;
//!   Meshtastic vendors the same blob without one.
//!
//! Nothing here is a programming language, and it must not become one. When
//! declarative data is not enough, the answer is a new transport in Rust
//! ("Deliberately not").
